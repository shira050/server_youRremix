# Spotify Remix Manager

## Overview
Spotify Remix Manager is a web application that allows users to manage their Spotify playlists and create remixes from their favorite songs. The application has an admin interface for managing users and user data. The project is built using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Python for the AI components that handle the remix generation.

## Features
- **User Management:** Admins can manage user accounts and user data.
- **Playlist Management:** Users can view and manage their Spotify playlists.
- **Remix Creation:** Users can select songs from their playlists to create remixes using AI.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **AI Component:** Python, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for audio processing

    ```

### AI Component Setup
1. Navigate to the AI directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../ai
    ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
